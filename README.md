# covid19-psvita-data
Fetches and reads json data about covid19. 

## Data Source
https://github.com/pomber/covid19

## About
This application was built in a few hours using code from [RepoHub](https://github.com/robDevs/RepoHub) for graphics, controls, curl requests, and json parsing. The visualization uses a logarithmic scale with log base 10. I have very little experience doing this type of visualization scaling so if there is a better way please let me know. With the short initial time spent making this application there will likely be bugs. Please report them using Github issues on this repository. 

## Purpose
I hope that this application will provide a convienent way for ps vita gamers to stay informed on the current state of Covid19. This application is not meant to replace any desktop alternatives.
